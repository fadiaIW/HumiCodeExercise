## Test Cases 

For testing, I would use Jest testing library, and below are some of the test cases I would consider : 
   
    1. Check if the APIs are being called successfully
    
    2. Check If List View component is rendering as it is expected to. 
    
    3. Check if search component is working as it is expected to.
